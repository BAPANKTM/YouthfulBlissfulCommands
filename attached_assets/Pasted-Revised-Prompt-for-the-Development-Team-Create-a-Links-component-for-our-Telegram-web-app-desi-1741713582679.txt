Revised Prompt for the Development Team:

"Create a 'Links' component for our Telegram web app, designed to manage Telegram bot interactions by displaying a list of file links uploaded by users. The component should use dummy data stored in 'public/data/links.json' to simulate functionality. The app already includes 'Home' and 'History' tabs, and the 'Links' tab should align with the 'History' tab’s structure, reusing the existing UI/UX framework. The 'Links' button is already in the navigation—do not recreate it or alter unrelated parts of the codebase.

Requirements for the 'Links' Tab:

List Display:
Display a list of links for files uploaded via the web app.
Each list item must show:
Nickname: The campaign name provided by the user.
Upload Date: The full date and time of link creation, presented professionally (e.g., 'October 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM UTC').
Total Lifetime Views: The total views the link has received.
A clickable element (e.g., a 'View Details' button or the list item itself) to access detailed information.
Detailed View:
On clicking a list item or its 'View Details' button, open a modal or separate view showing:
Full Link URL: The complete URL as text (no image or URL previews—display text only).
Nickname: The campaign name.
Creation Date and Time: The full date and time of creation, in a clear, professional format (e.g., 'October 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM UTC').
View Statistics: Buttons to toggle between:
Last 60 Minutes: Views in the last hour.
Last 48 Hours: Views in the last two days.
Lifetime: Total views.
Delete Option: A 'Delete Link' button triggering an alert (e.g., 'Delete functionality not implemented').
Navigation Controls:
Include a 'Close' button in the top-right corner of the detailed view, professionally styled and fully functional, to return to the list.
If the detailed view is a separate page, add a 'Back' button to navigate back to the 'Links' list, placed intuitively and working reliably.
Dummy Data:
Create a 'public/data/links.json' file with at least two sample link objects, each containing:
id: Unique identifier.
link: File URL (e.g., 'https://example.com/file1.jpg').
nickname: Campaign name (e.g., 'Campaign Alpha').
createdAt: ISO timestamp (e.g., '2023-10-01T12:00:00Z').
totalViews: Lifetime views (e.g., 150).
views: Precomputed view counts:
60minutes (e.g., 10).
48hours (e.g., 50).
lifetime (e.g., 150).
Constraints and Guidelines:

Reuse Existing UI/UX: Leverage current components and styles for seamless integration.
No Duplication: Do not duplicate existing code or components.
Front-End Only: Use static dummy data—no backend logic.
Responsiveness Warning: The UI must be short, compact, and fully responsive, adapting flawlessly to small screens (e.g., mobile) and large screens (e.g., desktop). Test across screen sizes to ensure no elements are hidden, overlapping, or misaligned—no bugs related to compatibility or responsiveness.
Professional UI/UX: Deliver a polished, bug-free experience. Ensure:
The 'Close' button is professionally designed, positioned in the top-right corner, and closes the detailed view without issues.
The 'Back' button (if applicable) is intuitively placed and navigates back to the list reliably.
All UI elements are visually appealing, consistent, and free of UX bugs.
No New Bugs: Verify that adding the 'Links' tab does not introduce issues (e.g., misaligned elements, broken buttons, or display problems) to the app.
Consistency: Match the design language of the 'Home' and 'History' tabs.
Deliverables:

A 'Links' component rendering the link list with dummy data.
A detailed view with textual link details and professional navigation controls (Close/Back buttons).
A 'public/data/links.json' file with sample data.
Focus on a clean, maintainable, and professional implementation. The UI must be responsive and compatible across all screen sizes, with no hidden or buggy elements. Remove all image or URL previews, display full date and time professionally, and ensure the 'Close' and 'Back' buttons are properly placed and functional, enhancing the user experience without disrupting the app."
